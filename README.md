This is a Unicode compatible font in the style of Sequoyah's original handwritten syllabary, before it was altered for use on the printing press in the years leading up to 1828. Contains glyphs for Cherokee Syllabary, but does not support numbers, puntuation, or any other langauges. Kerning is not suitable as a text or display font. It was utilized in house for graghic design projects.
